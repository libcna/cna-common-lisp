# Qualification: what each claim means, and what it does not

"Tested" is not one thing. This document defines the words the rest of the
repository uses, so that a green tick somewhere never gets read as a stronger
claim than the run behind it supports.

## The terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `REFERENCE_QUALIFIED` | Run on the reference runtime — **SBCL 2.5.2, Linux x86-64** — against a qualified CNA C ABI shared library. This is the configuration the capability statement in `README.md` is about. |
| `CI_TESTED` | Run by GitHub Actions on a runtime or a configuration that is *not* the reference one. Real evidence, and a weaker claim: a green `CI_TESTED` job says the code also works there, never that the reference qualification covers it. |
| `HEADLESS` | Executed against a CNA build whose renderer is `HEADLESS`. Proves the lifecycle ran and that draw commands were submitted and accepted. Proves **nothing** about pixels. |
| `NOT RUN` | A gate that did not execute, with the reason. Never written as a pass. |

Nothing in this repository may collapse two of those into "fully tested".

## The runtimes, and why there are two

The reference runtime is SBCL **2.5.2** on Linux x86-64. Ubuntu 24.04 — the CI
runner image — packages SBCL **2.2.9**. Those are different runtimes, three years
apart, and a suite that passes on one has not been run on the other.

So CI runs both, in jobs that say which is which:

| Job | Runtime | Claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Lisp` / reference | SBCL 2.5.2, installed from the upstream binary release and verified by SHA-256 | `REFERENCE_QUALIFIED` runtime, pure-Lisp gates |
| `Lisp` / distro | whatever `ubuntu-24.04` packages; the job prints the exact version | `CI_TESTED` — a secondary compatibility test, not the reference qualification |
| `Native` | SBCL 2.5.2, the same pinned binary release | the reference runtime, against a CNA C ABI built in the job |

`.github/actions/reference-sbcl` is the one place the reference runtime is
installed, and the version and its SHA-256 are pinned there. A substituted
tarball fails the checksum rather than quietly becoming "the reference runtime".

Locally, the reference runtime is Debian's build of the same upstream release
(`SBCL 2.5.2.debian`). Same version, different packaging; both are 2.5.2.

## The CNA source

The intent is to follow a moving branch: `openeggbert/cna`, branch `next`. That
is where the CNA C ABI 0.21.0 lives, and pinning by preference would mean the
binding stops noticing the day CNA's ABI moves — which is the one thing this
qualification exists to notice.

**As of 2026-09-04 that branch does not build from published sources, so
`CNA_REF` is pinned to `056e57d478f8e6accfa9124337803e735b39f1e4`.** The reason
is measured, not suspected:

* `openeggbert/cna:next` commit `822d3b960` ("scope isolated storage with game
  identity", 2026-09-03) made `modules/storage/src/StorageDevice.cpp` call
  `SharpRuntime::Storage::StoragePaths::SetIsolatedStorageRootOverride`;
* that member does not exist in `openeggbert/sharp-runtime:next` as published
  (`bd282d101640005454639b372f67e119ffa5642b`) — the sharp-runtime commit that
  adds it has not been pushed;
* so the build fails eleven minutes in, in CNA's storage module, with
  `'SetIsolatedStorageRootOverride' is not a member of
  'SharpRuntime::Storage::StoragePaths'`. Workflow run 33841079977 is the
  evidence.

This is not a CNA code defect. It is the consequence CNA's own `CHANGELOG.md`
predicts: "`sharp-runtime` is the exception and is not pinned by the build …
Recording the revision here is a stopgap." Two repositories moved out of step and
nothing enforces the pairing.

`056e57d47` is `822d3b960`'s parent. It is on `origin/next`, it is ABI 0.21.0, it
carries every route `docs/generated/native-abi-manifest.json` binds, and it does
not make that call. **The pin should be dropped the moment `sharp-runtime:next`
catches up**; until then `workflow_dispatch` with `cna_ref: next` is how to check
whether it has.

Following a branch, or a pin, is only honest if every run records where it
actually landed. So the `Native` workflow:

1. resolves `CNA_REF` to a commit immediately after checkout;
2. writes the requested ref, the resolved CNA commit, the sharp-runtime commit,
   the template commit and the CNA-Lisp commit into the run's step summary;
3. writes the same facts, plus the runtime version and the CNA build
   configuration, into `qualification-run.json` in the run's uploaded artifact.

`workflow_dispatch` takes `cna_ref` and `sharp_runtime_ref` inputs, so a specific
pairing can be qualified on demand without editing the workflow.

### sharp-runtime is CNA's unpinned dependency, and therefore ours

CNA consumes `sharp-runtime` as a *sibling checkout*, with `add_subdirectory` and
no recorded revision. CNA's own `CHANGELOG.md` says so in as many words --
"`sharp-runtime` is the exception and is not pinned by the build ... Recording the
revision here is a stopgap" -- so the pairing is the consumer's to make.

Getting it wrong is not a version error. It is a compile error a long way inside
CNA: building `openeggbert/cna:next` against `sharp-runtime`'s default `develop`
branch fails in `modules/storage/src/StorageDevice.cpp` with
`SetIsolatedStorageRootOverride is not a member of StoragePaths`, eleven minutes
into the build. `openeggbert/cna:next` needs `openeggbert/sharp-runtime:next`.

So the workflow checks out `sharp-runtime` at `SHARP_RUNTIME_REF`, defaulting to
`next` alongside CNA's `next`, records the commit it resolved to next to the CNA
one, and takes a `sharp_runtime_ref` dispatch input for qualifying a different
pairing. This is not a CNA defect; it is a documented property of how CNA is
built, and the remedy belongs here.

**An ABI artifact whose CNA commit was not recorded is not qualification
evidence**, and no document here may describe one as qualified.

## The CNA build this qualification uses

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Platform backend | `SDL3` |
| Audio backend | `SDL3` |
| Renderer | `HEADLESS` |
| C API | `CNA_BUILD_C_API=ON`, tests and examples off |
| ABI version admitted | 0.21.0 only |

CNA's vendored SDL submodules are initialised non-recursively and by name —
`third_party/SDL`, `third_party/SDL_image`, `third_party/SDL_mixer`,
`third_party/draco` — because CNA's own configure-time message says a recursive
init only adds nested codec submodules this build disables anyway.
`vendor/googletest` is not initialised, because `CNA_BUILD_TESTS` is off.

## The two native lanes

| Lane | Renderer | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Native` | `HEADLESS` | the lifecycle ran, handles were valid, and draw commands were submitted and accepted. **Nothing about pixels**, and the back-buffer readback refuses by name rather than answering zeroes. |
| `Rasterizer` | `SOFTWARE` | the same suite, plus two separate pixel proofs — see below. |

The rasterizer lane's proofs are kept apart because they are different claims,
and one of them used to be asserted on the strength of the other:

| Proof | What is actually done | What it establishes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clear` | clear to CornflowerBlue, read the back buffer | `GraphicsDevice.Clear` reaches the back buffer and the readback returns those pixels |
| `sprite` | clear, then draw a generated 8×8 fully opaque texture to an 8×8 destination at (16,16) with `BlendState.Opaque`, `SamplerState.PointClamp`, `Color.White`, no rotation/scale/origin — then read the corners of that rectangle *and* the pixels immediately outside it | **`SpriteBatch.Draw` rasterises**: the texture's own texels land on exactly the pixels its destination names, and on none outside them |
| `sprite` | the same with a generated 4×4 texture of four differently-coloured 2×2 quadrants | orientation and sampling are right, not merely placement — a flipped or transposed sample would fail |
| `primitive` | clear, make a `BasicEffect`, apply its one pass, then one `DrawUserPrimitives` triangle list in clip space — World, View and Projection left at the identity CNA reports as their default, `VertexColorEnabled` on and lighting off — then read four points inside the triangle and five outside it | **the primitive pipeline rasterises**: the vertices' own colour lands on the pixels the geometry covers and on none outside it, and no matrix setter and therefore no optional shim takes part in the proof |

The textures are **generated**, not drawn:
`tools/qualification/make-pixel-fixtures.py` states every texel in source, so the
expected colours are checkable without opening an image editor.

`tools/qualification/rasterizer.sh` requires **all three** kinds and fails if any
is missing, so the lane cannot pass on a clear alone, and the sprite path cannot
stand in for the primitive path — they are different paths through the renderer.
Verified in both directions: it exits 1 against a `HEADLESS` library and 0
against a `SOFTWARE` one.

They are separate jobs on purpose. They support different claims, and a failure
in one must not take down the other.

**The rasterizer lane needs no display and no Xvfb.** `SOFTWARE` is a CPU
rasteriser: a CNA configured with `-DCNA_GRAPHICS_RENDERER=SOFTWARE` runs
headlessly in the ordinary sense of the word while still producing real pixels.
That was measured before the lane was written, not assumed.

The lane cannot degrade quietly. `GraphicsDevice.GetBackBufferData` is the member
that reads pixels, and CNA answers `CNA_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED` for a renderer with
no honest readback rather than a buffer of zeroes — so every test branches on the
renderer that is actually present and asserts the truth for it, the runner prints
one line per proof that was obtained, and `rasterizer.sh` fails when a required
proof is absent.

### What is not in the rasterizer lane

**Every draw shape but the three above.** Each proof is one shape. The sprite
ones are axis-aligned, unrotated, unscaled, untinted opaque blits; the primitive
one is a single untextured, unlit, unfogged triangle list with no transform.
Rotation, scaling, tinting, blending, texturing, lighting, fog, indexed draws,
buffer-backed draws and every non-identity transform are submitted and accepted,
and no pixel of any of them is asserted anywhere.

**Compiled effects.** `Effect(GraphicsDevice, byte[])` is implemented, and
neither qualification renderer has `CNA_GRAPHICS_CAPABILITY_COMPILED_EFFECTS`, so
no effect with a reflected parameter graph has ever been loaded here.
`docs/limitations.md` says what that means for `EffectParameter`.

**No claim is made about a physical monitor.** Pixels in a back buffer are pixels
in a back buffer. Nothing here has been displayed to anyone.

**And no claim is made about a GPU renderer.** `SOFTWARE` rasterises on the CPU.
Nothing here says an OpenGL or Vulkan renderer would produce the same pixels.

## What HEADLESS does and does not prove

A HEADLESS run proves:

* the game loop ran, in CNA's own frame order, for exactly the frames requested;
* every lifecycle callback was delivered, and conditions raised inside one were
  contained rather than unwound through C;
* draw commands were submitted through the real native routes and accepted;
* handles were created and destroyed deterministically, and the callback registry
  was empty afterwards.

It proves nothing about rasterisation, blending, filtering, sampling or any other
pixel-producing behaviour, and nothing about a physical display. Where a member's
observable behaviour is pixels, the tests here assert command and state
submission and say so; the limitation is recorded in `docs/limitations.md` rather
than papered over.

## Where the evidence is

| Evidence | Where |

| Structural projection | `docs/generated/api-compat-report.json` |
| Bound native surface | `docs/generated/native-abi-manifest.json` |
| Public image of the loaded system | `docs/generated/public-surface.json` |
| Per-run CI qualification facts | the `cna-lisp-reports` artifact of each `Native` run |
